### Search terms; 
- When looking for images of people in athletic wear, we used terms like; People in athletic wear, Athletic clothing, Men/women working out, etc.
- When brainstorming for the logo, we came up with the idea and searched up sports logos with the key word pulse to see what kind of logos would come up to give us an idea.
- Searched for "color gradient css"
- Searched up sporting websites to get ideas of what we wanted our sports store layout to look like.
